# ***Abstract***

This report will cover the current info available about the known effects of carbon emissions on our average global temperatures. There will mainly be a summarized discussion about how the correlation between these two is found, what kinds of effects are caused by this relation, and what is being done to reduce those aforementioned emissions.

# ***Introduction***

The looming threat of the climate crisis has become an increasingly common topic amongst the general populace over time, typically bringing heated discussions about what should be done or even whether or not it's real. It has gotten to a point where there are several organizations dedicated to finding or encouraging ways to prevent further damage, even those brought about by the actions of children[^1]. However, this report will not be focusing on the back and forth banter between peoples, but rather the effects of one of the biggest contributors to global pollution: fossil fuel emissions. We will be going over the levels of carbon emission via fossil fuels and its relation to the steadily increasing temperatures of the world. The burning of fossil fuels is one of the biggest factors considered when talking about the effects of climate change and as such, I found a direct correlation between the two to be an interesting topic to research. The studies used for the basis of my research were those of data collection of the past several decades. These collections recorded the levels of carbon emission throughout the world as a whole in addition to a per country, and another collection of data detailing the shifts in average global temperature all over the same time period. Both for those who care for these issues and those who do not, I believe that showing a direct correlation in the patterns of the data that I have gathered would be an informing experience for any reader. I will start off by presenting the data that I have gathered in all forms, proceed to explain the patterns in each set of data, and then explain the relativity between the aforementioned sets.

# ***Methodology***

## ***I. 	Participants:***
The participants in this experiment are the countries of the world (e.g. China, United States of America, Canada, etc.) as the data used in this experiment is separated by country. Of these participants the largest contributors to the creation of carbon emission via fossil fuels were China by an incredibly wide margin and then the United States. Since my experiment is about the direct correlation between carbon emissions via fossil fuels and the rising mean temperature of the world, these 2 countries are the demographics with the largest impact on the possible results.

## ***II. 	Apparatus and Materials:***
    Apparatus:
    - Computers
    - CO^2 Analyzers
    
    Materials:
    - Graphs (Emissions per Country in 2014, Global Temperature levels, and 2 largest contributors to emissions overtime)
	    - RAWGraphs and Excel used to recreate some of these graphs for better quality.

## ***III. Procedure:***

The experiment will involve the results of these graphs, the patterns in each individual graph, and the connecting the perceived patterns to each other to see if there’s a noticeable link between them. As they are the 2 biggest contributors in the initial graph of recorded emissions in 2014, the 3 countries I will use as specific examples will be China and the United States. As such, our independent variables will be the emissions created by these countries (dubbed Country Emissions) while our dependent variable will be the world’s mean temperature (dubbed Global Temperature). To begin, we will look at the graph of the emissions per country recorded in 2014. For the sake of relativity purely in terms of emissions produced, I have only included the countries with values on the graph that were 80,000 and above.
